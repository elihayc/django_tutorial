2. movies - Ananas exercise

### Ananas exercise comments

**Tests** - an example for tests to the manager layer, It helped me during the development.
I would implement tests for the views, but it didn't work for me, and I didn't want to waste time on it. 

**Exception handling approach** - Throw an exception in case of error.

**Models** - I created Movie model as an example, and Person model was overwhelming for this exercise.
